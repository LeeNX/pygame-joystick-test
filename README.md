pygame-joystick-test is a small Python program that uses pygame to test joysticks. Upon running, it shows the state (axes, trackballs, hats and buttons) of all detected joysticks. It's a quick and simple way to check how well your joystick works. It was written in 2007-09-09 and hasn't been modified since then.
